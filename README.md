# This is the repo where I have my Bitburner scripts

- What is Bitburner?
  - A Coding/Automation Game about hacking and escaping the Matrix
  - On Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/
  - On GitHub: https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src
- Can I use your scripts?
  - Sure. But that will ruin the fun for you, so I suggest you don't
- God your Typescript is awful...
  - Yeah... It's my first time touching TS and JS for more than generating a simple HTML table. It's my way of learning TS
- It says "generated from bitburner-official/vscode-template" below the repo name, what's that about?
  - I have no idea how to use TS and didn't want to bother with setting up a nice working structure and the TS to JS conversion before even writing code. So I used this template as a starting point.
